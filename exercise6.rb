# Start with prompting the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit.
# Then call your method and pass in the user input as a parameter.
# Your method should:
# have one parameter: the temperature in Fahrenheit
# do the conversion with this formula: C = (F - 32) x 5/9
# ensure that the parameter you pass in is a number by converting it with â€‹ to_i
# Output the result in a full sentence using string interpolation.
# Don't forget to commit your progress as you go along. Once you're done, commit one last
# time and push it to github.
